# people_clusters_coordinates
A basic programme based on the pcl-peoplecluster-tutorial, the only modification is that this code publish the xyz-koordinates of peopleclusters in vectors. This code is definetly not optimized, as it is part of our bachelor thesis. Actually, most of our own comments are written in swedish. So... Yeah.. If you still want to use it, either try to translate or mail me.
